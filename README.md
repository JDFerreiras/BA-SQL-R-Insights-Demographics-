# SQL & R Analysis of ACS 1-Year 2015 Dataset  

This project analyzes U.S. demographic and economic data using SQLite and visualizes key insights with R.

## Features  
- SQL queries to extract population, income, and housing trends.  
- R scripts for data visualization using ggplot2.  
- Reproducible analysis for Business Analytics projects.  

## Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are:

**Analyze U.S. state-level demographic data** using **SQLite** to extract key insights.  
**Identify trends in population, income, housing values, and poverty levels** across different states.  
**Compare racial and ethnic compositions** in the most populous states.  
**Generate visualizations using R** to provide clear and informative representations of the data.  
**Ensure reproducibility** by providing a structured workflow, including SQL queries and R scripts for analysis.  

## Code Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

- **queries/insights.sql:** Contains all SQL queries used to extract insights from the SQLite database.
- **scripts/analysis_r.R:** The primary R script that connects to the SQLite database, retrieves data, and generates visualizations.

## Folder Structure  
- `sql/` → Contains all SQL queries.  
- `r/` → R scripts for data visualization.  
- `reports/` → Markdown reports with insights.  
- `images/` → Saved plots for easy reference.  
- `data/` → **(Not included)** Add SQLite database manually.
